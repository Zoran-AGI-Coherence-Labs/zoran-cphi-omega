## Scientific Architecture of Phenomenal Coherence and Operants  
**ZORANC🦋CφΩ**

### Description

This repository provides a **complete scientific framework** for analyzing system persistence through a strict separation between a **phenomenal law** (Cφ) and a **predictive gauge** (S).

The framework is **non-anthropocentric**, **non-normative**, **falsifiable**, and **independent of any implementation**.  
It applies to physical, biological, informational, institutional, and artificial systems.

Normative reference (White Paper):  
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17970269

## Core Concepts

- **Cφ (Phenomenal Coherence)**  
  A *law*, measured *a posteriori*, defined as an information-theoretic distance:  
  **Cφ = D_KL(P ‖ Q)**

- **S (Predictive Gauge)**  
  An *operational gauge*, used *a priori* to qualify the probable effect of an operant.

- **Ω (Measured Effect)**  
  The observed variation of phenomenal coherence: **Ω = ΔCφ**

- **Causal Chain (non-additive)**  
  **Operant → S → Ω → Cφ**

There is **no equation of evolution for Cφ** and **no feedback from Cφ to S**.

## What This Project Is

- A **scientific architecture**, not a simulation
- A **law + gauge separation**, not a dynamic model
- A **measurement framework**, not a decision system
- A **constraint on interpretation**, not a theory of everything

---

## What This Project Is Not

- ❌ Not a psychological model  
- ❌ Not a normative or ethical system  
- ❌ Not a control or optimization algorithm  
- ❌ Not a field theory or gauge symmetry theory  
- ❌ Not a machine learning framework

## Repository Contents

- **White Paper (normative)**  
  Scientific definition of the framework, law, methodology, and falsifiability.

- **Python Engine (instrumental)**  
  Reference implementation for:
  - computing S (predictive gauge),
  - measuring Cφ (phenomenal coherence),
  - enforcing category separation and causal ordering.

- **Technical Report**  
  Software companion describing implementation choices and limitations.

- **Falsification Tests**  
  Negative tests designed to reject invalid usages and category errors.

- **JSON API (IA-readable)**  
  Deterministic, stateless interface for IA↔IA integration without semantic drift.

---

## Scientific Status

- ✔ Phenomenal (not metaphysical)
- ✔ Non-anthropocentric
- ✔ Non-normative
- ✔ Locally falsifiable
- ✔ Independent of software implementations

The Python engine is **instrumental**.  
The law does **not** depend on the code.

## Final Note

This repository does not seek agreement.  
It enforces **clarity of categories, causality, and measurement**.

After this framework, the relevant question is no longer:  
> *“Is it true?”*  

but:  
> *“Is this usage respecting the rules of category, causality, and measurement?”*
